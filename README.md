# Kickstarter-analysis
Kickstarting in Excel
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To utilize the fundraising information within the excel sheet to determine what types of Fundraisers are more successful, and what time of year they appear to be more successful.

### Background
The Primary sheet contains a wide variety of data regarding fundraising campaigns. The data set goes into detail with the following parameters.( Name of campaign, description, raise goal, raise pledge, outsome of campaign, country campaign executed in, launch date, category of campaigns, length of campaign) With this data we look to analize the portion of data relevant to our analysis and that is learning how it would be most successful to launch a campaign for a theater play. 

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We dive  into our analysis looking at the the outcomes based off launch date we can assess the best time to have a campaign is in the months of May June and July.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We can tell from our analysis of the outcomes based on our goals that 0 campaigns were cancelled in the play sub category meaning they were successful or failed. The smaller the campaign goal was the more likely the campaign was to succeed. After aiming to reach a goal of $19,999 less than 50% of the campaigns were successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the biggest challenges in this assesment was to convert the time in the deadline annd launch date columns to an actual date via the year function.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that we can infer from the outcome of each campaign by start date is that in starting a campaign in May, June and July you are most likely to have a successful campaign. We can also infer that you should most likely try to stay entirely away from starting in December as it is most likely to fail if starting that month. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
When basing our campaign on what goal we should set it is most likely to be successful if we have our goal set to below $5,000. Anything higher than this and we will only have a %50 chance of success as displayed by the analysis of percentage of campaigns successful only reachign at the highest %55 above a ggoal of $5,000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

A limitation of this dataset could be we do not know how many people would be attending each event once executed. Knowing how many people would purchase an ability to see the finished product could make additional inferences for aiming what types of campaigns to go for.   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Another graph we could construct could be a line graph representing end dates of campaigns, and also a table that reflects on how long a campaign was. If each successful campaign was over the curse of "x" months and we have ours open for "y" months we may be unsuccessful given we follow the parameters of sttarting in may and under a $5,000 goal.
